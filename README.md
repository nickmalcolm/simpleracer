# Race

A very simple racing "game" I made for my 2.5 yr old. The worst kind of code you could ever find, cobbled together from everywhere.

![]()

## Pros

  - You can't do it wrong
  - There are emergency vehicles
  - There are noises
  - It goes on infinitely

## Cons

  - The code is gross
  - There are bugs if the player mashes keys (which 2.5yr olds will)

## Controls

|Key|Action|
|---|------|
|Left Arrow| Move Left |
|Right Arrow| Move Right |
|Space Bar|Toggle sound|
|1|Race Car|
|2|Ambulance|
|3|Police Car|
|4|Fire Truck|
